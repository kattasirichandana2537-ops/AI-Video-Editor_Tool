    "Content creators spend hours manually watching long-form videos (podcasts, interviews) to find short, engaging clips. This manual editing process is a significant bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Motivation\n",
    "By automating the discovery of viral moments, we can reduce editing time by 90%. This project builds a tool that listens to a video, understands the context using an LLM, and physically cuts the video into standalone clips automatically."
