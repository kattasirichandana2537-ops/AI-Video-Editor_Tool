    "\n",
    "a. Problem Statement\n",
    "Content creators spend hours manually watching long-form videos (podcasts, interviews) to find short, engaging clips (\"shorts\") for TikTok, Reels, or YouTube Shorts. This manual editing process is a significant bottleneck in content production.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Motivation\n",
    "By automating the discovery of \"viral moments,\" we can reduce editing time by 90%. This project builds a tool that \"listens\" to a video, understands the context using an LLM, and physically cuts the video into standalone clips automatically."
